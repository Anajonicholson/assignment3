How often does the model predict a sale when one fails to occur? How often does the model predict no sale when one does occur? Overall, does it provide accurate predictions?\n",

Turn `X_train` into an $N \\times 784$ matrix $X$ that is suitable for scikit-learn's kNN classifier where $N$ is the number of observations and $784=28*28$ (you could use, for example, a `for` loop).\n",
